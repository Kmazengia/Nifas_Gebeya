As a delivery driver, I want to be able to use a mobile app to facilitate and track my deliveries
so that I can efficiently manage them and provide real-time updates to both customers and the 
logistics team.

Acceptance Criteria:
===================
1. The mobile app should provide a user-friendly interface for drivers to log in and access their 
delivery tasks.

2. Upon logging in, the driver should be able to view a list of pending delivery orders, including 
relevant details such as delivery addresses, contact information, and delivery timeframes.

3. The app should allow drivers to select a specific delivery order and view detailed information 
about it.

4. Drivers should be able to mark the status of a delivery order as "In Progress," indicating that 
they have started the delivery process.

5. Once the delivery is complete, drivers should be able to update the order status to "Delivered" 
in the app.

6. Drivers should be able to view their delivery history and access details of past deliveries for 
reference.
